After conducting over 80 user interviews across my roles at Upfront and CloudCap, I've identified key patterns in how B2B buyers evaluate new solutions...

## The Three Critical Factors

1. **Trust Through Transparency**: Users need to understand not just what your product does, but how it works
2. **Integration Anxiety**: The fear of disrupting existing workflows is often the biggest barrier
3. **Champion Enablement**: Your users need tools to sell internally

These insights have shaped how I approach both partnership discussions and product development.
